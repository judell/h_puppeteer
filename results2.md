# Setup

In Chrome, the automated test is using the current stable distro of PDF.js, from https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/getting_started/#download, v2.0.943.

Interactively, I'm using:

1. Shipping Chrome extension with 1.1.25
2. Test Chrome extension with 2.0.943
3. Firefox with 2.1.97

The test extension is the H client tweaked in 2 ways:

1. The extension uses <a href="https://github.com/hypothesis/client/compare/master...judell:pass-ids-for-anchor-test">an extra id attribute</a> on anchored annotations so the test can correlate them to expected results.

2. The /web and /content folders contain PDF.js 2. In `viewer.js`:

    ```
    if (origin !== viewerOrigin && protocol !== 'blob:') {
      // throw new Error('file origin does not match viewer\'s');  // prevent this
    }
    ```
    and in viewer.html, as we do currently, 
    ```
    <script src="viewer.js"></script>

    <!-- Load Hypothesis client !-->
    <script type="application/json" class="js-hypothesis-config">
    {
      "assetRoot": "/client/",
      "sidebarAppUrl": "/client/app.html"
    }
    </script>
    <script src="/client/build/boot.js"></script>
    ```

# Updates

I've added the samples folder where I'll accumulate PDFs that are reported as anomalous and should be added to the test suite.

First: https://github.com/judell/h_puppeteer/blob/master/samples/Medieval%20Religion%20Selections.pdf. It reliably orphans in PDF.js 1 (in the stock Chrome extension), reliably works in FF and the experimental extension with PDF.js 2. 

# Summary

In this round I used 40 PDFs. They include those we've previously marked as problematic, plus a random selection of others. For each PDF I report four outcomes:

1. Test: `test.js` in Puppeteer using a Chrome extension with PDF.js v2 
2. Interactive/FF/PDF2: Firefox with its built-in PDF.js 2
3. Interactive/Chrome/PDF1: The shipping extension
4. Interactive/Chrome/PDF2: The same PDF.js v2 extension used in 1.

I've marked test results with non-zero orphans as  * (`anomaly`). 16 of 40 are so marked. In these cases I've explored why there are orphans. 6 are explained by <a href="https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/954">overlap</a>, 2 by the page-boundary issue. 

In 9 cases, the interactive results for Chrome with PDF.js 2 and Firefox with (a slightly newer) PDF.js, do not agree. This is puzzling. 

| code | label | count |
|--|--|--|
| * | anomaly | 16
| ** | FF/PDF2 != Chrome/PDF2 | 9
| + | <a href="https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/954">overlap</a> | 6
| ^ | page boundary | 2
|  | all | 40

The main purposes of this round of testing were:

1. Validate that use of Chrome/PDF2 is automatable with Puppeteer

2. Characterize the patterns that began emerging in the first round.

The number of tested PDFs is still small. My plan for round 3 is to leverage the fact that testing with both Chrome/PDF1 and Chrome/PDF2 is now automatable, and to compare results for both across a much larger randomly-selected set of annotated PDFs. We'll want to know:

- In what % of cases do they agree?

- When they disagree, how likely is it that either PDF1 or PDF2 gives the "better" result?

That would, however, leave still unanswered the question: Why the differences between FF/PDF2 and Chrome/PDF2. So before starting a large-scale test, it might be helpful for someone to review the setup here and look for issues that might explain that difference.

Test reveals a silent failure to anchor, in all client modes. Annotation <a href="https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/954">overlap</a> is not a factor here.

This was the seed of https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/954. 

The one orphan reported by all modes: 

https://jsoneditoronline.org/?url=https://hypothes.is/api/annotations/gEyOdoRxEea9wK8ixCQPow

{"exact": "In class, we flipped through the yellowing pages of racist literature and the counterliterature that fought back.", "prefix": " history, albeit a painful one. ", "type": "TextQuoteSelector", "suffix": " It did indeed make the incident"}]}

This is a known failure mode. There's a pagebreak between "racist literature and" and "the counterliterature". PDF.js lazily loads into per-PDF-page HTML divs, and we only look at one of those at at time. In this case, the orphan begins on page 16 and continues on 17. 

The pages that PDF.js has loaded at this point are 15, 16, and 17. So the data we'd need to anchor this annotation does live in the DOM, and could in principle be gotten. 

Then there are the four unreported orphans. (These appear to be counted in the sidebar's Annotations tab, even though not anchored.)
  
1 https://jsoneditoronline.org/?url=https://hypothes.is/api/annotations/JEeXXoBZEeawhx-THRaiCA

{"exact": ", and", "prefix": "e explosion and subsequent spill", "type": "TextQuoteSelector", "suffix": " stopping the flow initially see"}]}

Overlaps almost exactly with this annotation that does anchor:

https://jsoneditoronline.org/?url=https://hypothes.is/api/annotations/RuscgnYwEea7LwNN0ponHw

{"exact": ", and ", "prefix": "e explosion and subsequent spill", "type": "TextQuoteSelector", "suffix": "stopping the flow initially seem"}]}

2 https://jsoneditoronline.org/?url=https://hypothes.is/api/annotations/rUz5UoDYEeaqGgcYaJoSZg

{"exact": "public subjects are never single", "prefix": "st also happen within networks; ", "type": "TextQuoteSelector", "suffix": ". Therefore, becom-ing oriented "}]}

Occurs in a region of heavy overlap.

3 https://jsoneditoronline.org/?url=https://hypothes.is/api/annotations/-afq4IDeEea20kO4RMsmFw

{"exact": ", networks are not human", "prefix": "ions among elements. Furthermore", "type": "TextQuoteSelector", "suffix": "-or at least they are not merely"}]

Occurs in a region of heavy overlap.

4 https://jsoneditoronline.org/?url=https://hypothes.is/api/annotations/4qkWwoAPEeadyud9XjPFMA

{"exact": " ", "prefix": "cess necessarily sustainable? In", "type": "TextQuoteSelector", "suffix": "chapter r, I ar-gued that sustai"}]}

No overlap involved here. The target is, admittedly, just a single space. And "chapter r" is a bogus rendering of "chapter I". But the prefix is unique to the document, so it seems like it _could_ work. OTOH, PDF.js is not 100% capable of searching this rendering of a scanned PDF. The complete sentence containing the prefix is:

> "But why is this inqu iry process necessarily sustainable?"

The space in "inqu iry" is not evident to the reader. But a PDF.js search for "inquiry process necessarily" fails, whereas a search for "inqu iry process necessarily" succeeds.

The lone orphan, target "A. Consent to Assignment", is unaffected by overlap. But it occurs at the end of a page so may run afoul of the page-boundary issue. In FF it was necessary to scroll to the page to make the orphan show up. (The test, which visits every page, forces that to happen.) Although Chrome/PDF1 reports no orphans, it actually misanchors to "en consent. No consent" which occurs at the top of the next page.
